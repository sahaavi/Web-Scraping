My name is Sebastian. And, yeah, that's me. When my mother used to dress me for pre-school, like I was going to Studio 54. Like most American stories, mine starts a long time ago on another continent. Specifically, the magical island of Sicilia. (BLEATING) SEBASTIAN: A lot of folks like to call Sicily the big ball in front of the boot of Italy, which makes sense 'cause the world's been trying to kick our ass since the dawn of time. (ELEPHANT TRUMPETS) (WHIP CRACKS) (WOMAN SCREAMING) SEBASTIAN: For generations, my people have been threatened by wars, volcanoes, and testicle-crushing Speedos. (GOAT BLEATING) But we survived it all through one unstoppable force. Family. These are actual photos of my Sicilian ancestors. Note the signature Maniscalco look. With the curved spines and the resting bitch face, like a bunch of pissed-off candy canes. Over the past few centuries, these proud hunchback men have operated with one goal. Do everything you can... (COW MOOS) ...to give your kids a better life than the one you had. For my father, this meant leaving his beloved Sicily for Chicago. So he and my mother could give me opportunities they never got. Like shoveling snow. Growing a beautiful mullet. And going to the prom looking like a pit boss. (SLOT MACHINE CHIMING) (MAN WHISTLING) SEBASTIAN: Growing up, my father busted his hump to instill in me certain rules of how a man should operate. Like, if you're awake, you should be workin'. Hey, how's the pressure, Mrs. Marinelli? Harder. You got to get in there, son. I don't pay you by the hour, I pay you by the moan, capisce? (MOANING) SEBASTIAN: Guy with the ponytail, that's my dad. (MOANING CONTINUES) Did I mention he owns a salon? The man comes from a long line of Sicilian hairstylists. And don't you dare call him a barber. This man doesn't just cut hair, he creates styles. Salvo, it's beautiful. See? I told you you had cheekbones under there. You just needed Michelangelo to dig them out. SEBASTIAN: Child labor laws were definitely broken. But on the bright side, I had the most realistic Chewbacca costume in the history of Halloween. (MIMICS CHEWBACCA'S GROWL) SEBASTIAN: He taught me to always save your money. No apps, no dessert. And if you don't finish your main, you're paying for your own birthday dinner. SEBASTIAN: And to be resourceful. You wanted me to buy you a skateboard, I built you one instead. Next year, I'm gonna build you one of those Nintendos. SEBASTIAN: But one exception, cologne. Never cheap out on your signature scent. At bedtime, our house smelled like an Uber in Las Vegas. The only time I saw my father smile is when we did the chicken dance for my mother. To me, this man was a God. And it was all working out great until I grew up, and fell for someone who was my complete opposite. Her name was Ellie. I mean, look at this girl. The style, the positivity, personality. Yeah, this was my dream woman. Sebastian! Ah! I'm so sorry I'm late. This guy's charging $15 for valet. So I parked it nine blocks away. Wait a minute, if you parked that far away, how are you so dry? You sweat just getting the mail. It's the Fendi, babe. It's wicking away. (LAUGHING) You want one? Yeah. You know, everyone said I should serve fancy food at my opening, and I was like, "Name one person that doesn't like a hot dog." SEBASTIAN: And get this, she's an artist. I mean, growing up, I wasn't even allowed to do it as a hobby. So how's the show going? Oh, my God! Freaking amazing. All my pieces sold out in like 15 minutes. Babe, that's incredible. I know, right? I mean, most of them went to this big decorator, but they have clients all over the world, so I'm not complaining. Well, you shouldn't. Especially because they look, kind of like, you know... ELLIE: Vaginas? Well, you know, if you just hang them horizontally, they kind of look like sunsets. Oh, yeah. (SOFTLY) Right. SEBASTIAN: Since the day I met her, she's been opening my eyes to all kinds of new experiences. Like naps. Weird. The sun's coming through the drapes. And beauty treatments. Hey, hot stuff. Looking good. Wait, are you mad? Yeah. That it took 42 years to discover avocado masks. And last but not least, smiling. Okay. Um... It's not natural. That's... That's not particularly natural. But you know what I think? I think we just have to build these facial muscles, so you just got to practice. Look at that. Now try it. I don't... (GASPS) You look great. SEBASTIAN: Yeah, life with Ellie was pretty perfect. (MY MAN BY CRUSH CLUB PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) SEBASTIAN: I don't think I could participate. That's just ridiculous. ELLIE: You promised. Oh, come on! A public wedding proposal? It's embarrassing. ELLIE: I think it's sweet. When I propose to you, it's going to be intimate. Hmm. Just you and me, the way it should be. Hmm. No one else. Used to be, "If I propose." You just said, "When I propose." Okay, babe, it's just... I'm aggravated. Words are just flying out of my mouth. Well, just so you know, the only way I will say yes, is if there is some element of public humiliation involved. Oh, well. Get ready. You might as well just end the relationship right now, because we ain't doing that. Oh, we're not? I'm not doing this. But you're such a good dancer. Look at these people. MAN: Uh, Ellie? I kind of need your help right now. Right, dude, we are in! (PEOPLE CHEERING) SEBASTIAN: The truth was, I had every intention of asking Ellie to marry me. I just needed the right place and time. SEBASTIAN: I see you, guy. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) I see you. All right? Pick it up. Thank you. Take a walk. ELLIE: Sebastian. I'm on the phone with my parents and get this, they're inviting us out to the summer place for the big 4th-of-July weekend. Babe, did you just say "us"? Us. I thought this trip was for family only. I know! I mean, I'm so torn between thinking this is great news, or that I might be dragging you into an Italian version of Get Out. (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PHONE) I'm not sure. Oh, uh, uh... Yes, yes, yes, Mother, yes. I'm asking him right now, please hold. (MOUTHING) What do you think? (SNIFFLES) ELLIE: (SIGHS) Yeah. He's man-crying. That means it's a yes. Yes! I love you. I'm gonna get you tissues. I love you. I'm so excited. SEBASTIAN: So, yeah, I'm a big crier. I love to just marinate in my own tears. BOTH: Mmm. SEBASTIAN: But this was a huge deal. Ellie's summer place wasn't just the perfect spot to propose. It also meant her family was starting to accept me. Which was amazing, because... How do I put this eloquently? These people got class up the ass. I mean, look at these people with their perfect postures, and their perfect teeth. Even their dog went to better schools than I did. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) SEBASTIAN: I was intimidated, which really didn't make any sense as their story was also an immigrant story. For some reason, theirs was considered more respectable, as it started 400 years ago. Now, this is an actual painting of Ellie's 10th great grandfather, William Love Collins, taking his family to America, on a little boat called the Mayflower. You got it. That one. So while my father came to chase the American dream, the Collins were the American dream, all the way up to Ellie's dad. William Love Collins XII. Only Italian guys I knew with Roman numerals after their names... (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) ...are popes, and Rocky Balboa. (INDISTINCT CHEERING) Her dad is the chairman and CEO of the luxurious Collins Hotel Group, which was awkward, as I happened to run a cool new boutique hotel, which was stealing a lot of his Chicago business. Bottom line? His baby girl was dating the enemy. But Bill wasn't even the scary parent. That honor belonged to Ellie's mother, whose actual birth name was Tigger MacArthur. Anna, darling, you don't know anything about me. SEBASTIAN: And this kitty's got claws. As an Ivy League grad-turned-senator for the state of Maryland, it took her a long time to wrap her mind around her beloved daughter dating some working-class hotel manager. How could I be anti-immigrant when my daughter is dating the son of one? SEBASTIAN: But this invite meant I was finally breaking through. A holiday weekend was my chance to charm the pleated pants off these people. And if all went well, I could ask for their daughter's hand in marriage. So, I had the girl I wanted to marry, the perfect spot to propose to her, and now, I just needed the ring, which should have been easy to get. Oh, come on. What do you mean you're not gonna give me the ring? Grandma left it for me to use when I'm ready to get married. SALVO: Uh, your grandmother left it with me to make sure you just don't give it away to some puttana, that's what your grandmother did. Can you come out of the garden so we can talk about this? (LEAVES RUSTLING) They're back. They're back there messing with my gagootz. Forget the gagootz. Dad, the ring, can I have it? Look at that. You know, I don't know about this girl, I gotta tell ya. I'm not sure about her. She put her feet up on my coffee table, I don't know... You put your feet up on your coffee table. Yeah, my coffee table, my feet. What do you think is this? What bites? A raccoon? Ants? Is it an ant? An ant. You got to to be kidding me. Let's see. Okay, here we are. Look at them. That's a possum. Possum. They're dead. Dead, gone. Oh, no. Come on, with the thing again... Gone from this earth. Instant death. Just set a trap. Yeah, I'm gonna set a trap. I'm gonna get my antifreeze, my little... SEBASTIAN: When I was a kid, I thought everything my dad did was normal. If some string beans went missing, I'd wake up to a yard full of poisoned squirrels, birds, chipmunks, basically anything that ever helped Cinderella get dressed, murdered in our backyard. Come on, Dad. Could you just admit that Ellie's not some puttana? I love her, you love her. Just give me the ring so I can propose. You really serious about this? Yeah, Dad, she's the one. She's the one? Yeah. Okay, son, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna give you the ring. Thank you. But first I gotta meet her family. What? Why? Why? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) That's why. What the hell does that mean? (SCOFFS) You got no respect for your roots. I mean, what are you talking about? You don't eat the fruit till you make sure the tree ain't sick. And per tradition, I need to look at the mother and the father's eyes. I need to look them in the eyes to make sure there's no rot. Because there could be rot. Not that there is. What? But there could be. There's no rot in this family, Dad. You never know. They're classy. You never know. Come on, they're classy people. Oh, yeah. The fancier, the dirtier. You never know what's going on. Plus, they don't live anywhere near here. So let me just put you on a FaceTime, so you could taste test them over the phone. Hey, I'm not doing FaceTime. This is an important moment. FaceTime, Zoom? What are you, crazy? You don't gotta get all upset. No, gotta be faccia con faccia. Dad, I want to do this next weekend at their family's house in the country. Wait... wait. Hold on, hold on. This is the first summer since we had to say goodbye to your poor dear mother, and you're going to leave me alone for the goddamn 4th of July? Well, it's just that, you know, her family invited me to their summer house. Oh, their summer home? Oh, most people got one home, but they got 'em for different seasons. Oh, that's nice. Come on, Dad. So they got more money than us, who doesn't? Plus, it's just for one weekend. Oh, one weekend, he says. One weekend. Fifty years ago, I come to this country to give you a better life. Fifty years ago, I skipped every weekend in Sicily for you. I joined the US Army to protect your freedoms. And what thanks do I get? You go celebrate the 4th of July with some other family, leaving me to burn the sparklers and eat the hot dogs alone! Alone! Thank you. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) This is incredible. (CONTINUES IN ITALIAN) Wait, what do you mean you're not coming? I can't leave my father. The 4th of July was their favorite holiday. Because of his military background? No, it's the only holiday you don't have to buy a gift. I'm sorry, Ellie. We'll just do it some other time. Why don't we just bring him? (HESITATES) What happened? I mean, if he... loves the 4th, he's gonna flip out at our place. There's all kinds of fun family activities. There's fireworks. There's even a huge clambake with tons of fresh fish. He loves to de-bone fish. Kind of perfect. SEBASTIAN: My father getting a close-up look at my new life, while I was trying to seal the deal with Ellie's parents? What an incredible idea! Nah, I don't think so. I should probably just stay here with him. Boo! Come on. Don't you want our families to finally meet? (IN HIGH-PITCH) Yeah, of course I do. Why is your voice going up like that? What's going on? Are you... Are you nervous to bring him? Ner... No. (CHUCKLES) No. What? No, no. All right, fine. Don't bring him. Don't come. Don't have fun. It's fine. SEBASTIAN: All right, maybe I was a little scared to bring my father into a country club environment, where he'd see me playing racquet sports, riding around in golf carts, and taking naps. But I also knew that stubborn bastard wouldn't give me the ring without a face-to-face meeting. Fine. You win. I'll ask him. (EXCLAIMS HAPPILY) Hey, don't get all excited, all right? This guy's big on tradition. I doubt he'll even say yes. Shit, yeah. I'm coming. No, wait, wait, wait. Seriously? Of course, I'm coming. What are we gonna do instead? Spend the whole weekend alone, just the two of us in the house, burning the sparklers and eating the hotdogs? Yeah, I'm coming. That's the same example you used to guilt trip me into not going. Well, what can I say. I got a way with words. You know me. All right, listen. If we're gonna do this, Dad, you gotta be on your best behavior. Wha... What do you mean, my best behavior? The family is uptight, they're conservative, they're not used to... Hold on, hold on, hold on. So, you, the son, are telling me, the father, how to behave? You hear this? Just remember the main goal is for you to meet the family, so I can get the ring and propose to Ellie. It's not for you to price check their antique coffee tables. Come on, already! I mean, how fancy could a stupid coffee table be? I mean, seriously, how much we talking? I don't know, Dad. I'm kidding you. Mannaggia. (IN ENGLISH) Where's your sense of humor? Jeez. Come on. All I'm asking is dial it down with the... (MOCKING SALVO) What, all the... This is... What is this? Look at him. Look at him. Dial it down with all this and that. You know what he's worried about? He's worried his immigrant father's gonna make him look like some kind of goombah. Let me tell you something. You don't remember this because I'm your dad but a lot of people find me charming, pretty charming, that's right. Right. Right, ladies? WOMEN: Yeah. (CHUCKLES) And these stuck-up rich people? They got a word for me... I remember, it's loud, it's obnoxious, it's over-cologned. No, no. "Refreshing." "He's refreshing." "He's so original." I've heard that all... All the time I hear that. And I promise you Ellie's parents are gonna love me. I don't know about you, but they're going to love me. Mm-hmm. Ladies, you better get your 'dos done by Thursday 'cause the Maniscalco men, they're going on vacation. He's worried. This kid is worried. I'm not. ( IL MONDO BY IL VOLO PLAYING) (LIGHTER CLICKS) What the hell are you doing? You can't smoke here. What? I'm outside. Next to an airplane! Oh, sorry! STEWARDESS: That's okay. Mannaggia. Can't even smoke a cigar. I got some good news. I got us a luxury sedan for the price of a compact. That's nice, but makes me wonder how much the compact you could've got for. Then I took the compact price and got it on the house! (CHUCKLING) Hey! Hey! Nice! Baby, the bags. Yeah. How long does it take to get there? Um, like, three hours. Hey, you guys looking for a ride? (GASPS) Oh, my God. Lucky! SEBASTIAN: Oh, no. Who's that, an ex-boyfriend? Worse. Brother. LUCKY: Hey! (ELLIE SCREAMING) (ELLIE SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY) SEBASTIAN: While I'd made progress with Ellie's parents, I'd yet to make any with the older brother. His name was William Love Collins XIII. So, everybody called this guy "Lucky." And that's exactly what he was. ALL: Chug, chug, chug, Whoo! Oh, my God! SEBASTIAN: After graduating from Princeton, back when you could bribe your kid into college, Lucky was on deck to take over the Hotel Group while working as a "Client Liaison." Gentlemen! Who's ready to go hunt some endangered species? I'm just kidding. Unless you guys are down, I can figure something out. SEBASTIAN: This meant traveling around the world, entertaining wealthy clients with all the rich kid hobbies he had time to master. Whoo! SEBASTIAN: We're talking skiing... Whoo! Snowboarding sucks! SEBASTIAN: ...y achting. (SLURPING) ...all the country club sports. Whoo! Looks like I gotta change my shoes, 'cause I'm on the dance floor. What! (EXCLAIMING IN EXCITEMENT) SEBASTIAN: But I'd say his overall best skill was being a prick. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) LUCKY: There he is. I see you're still banging the bellboy. ELLIE: Luck! No! LUCKY: Hey! I'm only joking, Sea Bass. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hey, what's up, Luck? (IN ENGLISH) Not much. You must be Sebastian's brother. Hey. No, I'm his father. Salvo. How are you? No way! Seriously? That's crazy. I can't tell the age of anybody over 40. (SCOFFS) Anyway. Oh, let me goose you guys some free samps. I'm an angel investor in this new anti-aging skin cream for men and I'm obvi a client. (CHUCKLES) This guy. You boys ready to saddle up? (GASPS) LUCKY: Let's go! Oh, chopper time! El... El, I don't think this is such a good idea. Yeah, we got a free car, you know. Guys, come on! Trust me, the helicopter takes 20 minutes, and the views are magical. Are you with me? (SIGHS) Come on! Let's have some fun! MAN: (ON RADIO) Lucky, you are cleared for takeoff. LUCKY: Roger that, Roger. Dude's name is Roger. We hang. Got a super-hot wife. Hey, if you guys look out to your left, you'll see the beautiful Roanoke River. ELLIE: Baby, look. Salvo, it's nice, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's nice. Reminds me of 'Nam. (EXHALES) Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. It's good. Okay. Okay. I'm fine. (THUDDING) Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I got it. I got it. (ELLIE CHUCKLES) (LUCKY CHUCKLING) Had a couple too many G and Ts. He's kidding. He's kidding. SALVO: Yeah, yeah. The air don't work. SALVO: No, it does. It works, it works. It's okay. Only a couple of minutes. It's just a little warm, Dad. Son, it's... I think we got a problem here. What? We got a problem here. Oh, my God! Baby! (SEBASTIAN WHEEZING) Yeah, I can't breathe. Wait, wait, wait. Take a bite out of the lemon. It'll help with the nausea. I'm not doing a whole lemon. I'll cut it. I'll cut it. Don't worry. Hey. I'll cut it into pieces. Hold on. I got a knife. (GASPS) He's got a knife. Oh, my God. He's got a knife. I'm cutting the lemon. Okay, here. Take it. Take it. Baby, suck it. Suck on that. ELLIE: Suck on that lemon. Suck. ELLIE: Just suck! Suck, suck, suck! LUCKY: Sounds like my Saturday night. ELLIE: Suck! LUCKY: Dude. Do not vom in my bird. He's not gonna vom in your bird. Just breathe in through the nose, out through the mouth. SALVO: Suck on that. It's making it worse. Suck it! LUCKY: Cradle the balls. SALVO: Suck on that! ELLIE: You just suck! Just suck it. Suck the lemon! SALVO: Take it easy, kid. I think we should turn around. He's freaking out. It's like 19 more minutes. You can't tough it out for 19... It stinks! Let's bring it down. Let's bring it... Open up the windows! I'm gonna die! Put the air conditioning down there. Bring it down. How are you so calm? LUCKY: Roger, we're coming back. I'm dying! Put it down! Put it down! Ah! (SIGHS) I knew I should've forced him to join the army. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Laugh it up. Laugh it up, guys. I'm just happy I'm on the ground. Okay, gentlemen. Welcome to White Oak. Wow! Right? Ah, boy. Um, okay, so, that's the golf course, and then the tennis courts are back down there. Oh, baby, look. Right there? That's my childhood fort. SEBASTIAN: Oh. ELLIE: We'd go there. whenever I needed to get away from my family. So, basically, all the time. Yeah, I wish I had one. (GASPS) Oh, look! Oh, my God! It's Sergeant Feathers and his family! SEBASTIAN: What is this? Oh, my God! SEBASTIAN: What are you doing? (GASPS) What up, dudes? SEBASTIAN: What are you... Is this safe? Yeah, no, she's crazy. What's that? What are you doing? Be careful. SEBASTIAN: Get back in the car! They're gonna eat you alive! Oh, my God! Aren't they the best? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're so beautiful! So how much a peacock cost anyway? SEBASTIAN: Don't answer that, El. SALVO: I didn't know they had peacocks in Virginia. Oh, well, my grandfather brought two here decades ago, but they didn't like their cages, so he decided to let them roam free. And now, they've pretty much just become the official mascots of our club. Well, they're bad luck where I come from. They're just a bunch of goddamn showoffs, if you ask me. I don't like them. They're lucky to be born that way. They could've been born like a chicken, or a pigeon. I mean, it just has fancy feathers, so all of a sudden, it gets more respect. (CHUCKLES) Okay, guys. We're here. Welcome to our house. SEBASTIAN: Look at this! Are you kidding me? SALVO: How much a house like this cost? SEBASTIAN: Enough with the Price is Right! ELLIE: He's the Bob Barker of the backseat. (SEBASTIAN GROANS) (CAR HORN HONKING) Oh, my little cuddle monkey! Hey! Hi! Hi. (TIGGER LAUGHING) Oh, my girl. BILL: Oh! Oh, what a beauty! Ellie-Bellie! SEBASTIAN: You know, looking back at this, my dad had to be overwhelmed. Family's a little handsy, huh? It's called love and affection, Dad. Unlike you, when you met me in the delivery room and chose to shake my hand. What else was I supposed to do? We just met. (SIGHS) Huh? ELLIE: Guys, come on. I want you to meet Sebastian's father. Hey, Sebastian. Hi. Nice to see you. Pleasure. Welcome. SALVO: Nice to meet you. Sebastian, so good to see you. And you must be the charming Salvo. So nice to finally meet you in person, Tigger. It's just last week I was checking out your highlights on TV. Oh, the CNN or the Fox ones? No, no, the blonde ones. You hair, if I can say, is just like a block of marble. I wanna sink my tools into it. Dad, Dad, Dad, what are you doing? Sorry, I mean, it's... You're gonna hit her. Well, Salvo, we've heard you're quite the stylist. Now, tell me this, do you think I'm too old to pull off a set of frosted tips? (ALL LAUGHING) "Frosted tips?" Good one, sir! Solid gold! All right, I'm gonna hit the links. ELLIE: Have fun! LUCKY: Hasta luego! So, uh, why don't you come inside, and we'll give you the grand tour. Don't worry about the bags. Wendell will take care of them. ELLIE: Mommy... SALVO: That's a pretty big dog you got there. BILL: Oh, that's Duke. We don't get too rough with him, 'cause we're afraid he'll kill us. (ALL LAUGHING) He's so big! ELLIE: Dad! BILL: This is our house. SEBASTIAN: Wow! TIGGER: Yes. SALVO: It's unbelievable. TIGGER: It's so big. (ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) TIGGER: Oh, this is our youngest son, Doug. He's practicing... ELLIE: Hi! ...his sound bowls. Oh, yeah... Sound bowls? What is that? Oh, well, now, a sound bowl is... It's, actually, it's an instrument. It puts out this vibration that relieves stress and promotes relaxation. He's... he's learning to be a healer. (CHUCKLING) Uh, but we're just so proud of him. You're so loud, Dad. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry, sorry. Let me just... Sorry. No, I'm gonna close the... Play, boy, play. Play to soothe the savage beast. Well, you don't have to shut 'em. (BILL CHUCKLING) Wow! This house is amazing! Look at this! TIGGER: This is nothing. You should see the place in Aspen. (ALL CHUCKLING) Well, it's just, you know... Yeah. I love this cocktail table. Oh, Sebastian! Good eye! The first commercial coal mine in the country was right down the road from here, and this piece is made out of the wood from one of the original mine cars. Drenched in history. Drenched. Good for you, re-using old wood like that. BILL: Yes. This guy always gets on me about picking up trash and putting it in the house. (CHUCKLES) Trash? It's crazy, the stuff that people throw away these days. It sure beats paying for it, I mean, right? So, I... I take it. Right. Yes. Yes. That is so true. Yeah. Um, actually, though, we did pay for this one. (ELLIE CHUCKLES) A king's ransom, (CHUCKLES) if I must say, but at least it's too rickety to put drinks on. (ALL CHUCKLING) Dad, that's the worst. No, no, we just, we wanted something that matched the art in the room. SALVO: Oh, good for you, hanging up your kids' art work like that. No, these are original Grandma Moseses. Can you believe it? I'm... I'm sorry. BILL: We found them... I'm sorry. BILL: What? I'm sorry. I mean, I... I didn't mean to insult your grandmother. I meant no disrespect. I had no idea. I mean, what was the matter with her? Was she a little... (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) Oh, my God. Hey, who's hungry for lunch? I am. ELLIE: Me, me, me! We could all go down to The Shack. ELLIE: Oh, Salvo, you're gonna love The Shack! What a great idea! (WE NO SPEAK AMERICANO PLAYING AS RINGTONE) It's me. Wow, this club is huge, Bill. The way you were describing it, I expected a place where they're serving grilled cheese out of a little window, you know. Yes, I suppose they've fixed it up over the years. But to us it will always be... BOTH: The Shack. This place was built by slaves. Douglass. What, I'm not allowed to tell the truth now? How are we supposed to confront our problems if we don't talk about it, Dad? No, it's true. It's true. The... Some of the history down here is just... it's brutal. Mmm. It's just unthinkable. It's not on the menu, but you can order the club sandwich with lobster. You know, I can't even bring my girlfriend here because I'm ashamed. She's an African person. She is a person emailing you from Africa, and to whom you are sending back money. We have yet to confirm whether she's a girl or a friend. Keep me safe from negative energy. Hi, everyone. Welcome to White Oak. What can I get you guys? Oh, no bread, please. Um, do you have those crackers? The seedy ones? Of course. Gloria, do you have kombucha? I can check. Does anyone want in on this? Ever since I've had kombucha, my BMs have been ...completely regular. BILL: Oh. All right. I've had no problems. All right. Remember, Douglass, we don't talk about our BMs at the table. No. Before I was drinking kombucha, my feces looked like ripped, little pieces of paper and then after I started drinking, they're long, soft logs. (BILL CHUCKLES) Well, all right. Thank you for that. Um, do you know what you want, Sebastian? Just a... the Cobb salad. BILL: Good choice. What are you, one of my sorority sisters? (CHUCKLING) Is that all you're gonna get? You're not gonna get a starter? Yeah, uh, I'm just gonna stick with the middle of the menu. ELLIE: All right, suit yourself. Salvo, what are you gonna get? Gloria, I think I'm gonna have the... the BLT with the onion rings. But what's the price on that dish? Oh, no, we don't... Salvo, this may sound very silly but we don't like to put prices on things, because it's just an annoying reminder of money. Right? Oh! (CHUCKLES) So, everything's for free, you mean? (CHUCKLES) No. No, it is not free. (LAUGHS) I wish it were. TIGGER: (LAUGHING) Nothing is free. So, what do they do? I mean, they make up a price, or... Oh, Dad, it's... you know... Son, I'm talking to Bill, here. Are you Bill? Hello, Bill. BILL: (CHUCKLING) It's fine. Everything has a set price. Mmm. And then they just tally it up at the end of the week, put it on my bill, and it's taken care of. Got it. Okay, got it. Well, Gloria, I would just love to chat with somebody who knows the prices. TIGGER: Salvo, please. Please. It would be our pleasure to treat you. I would love that and thank you, Tigger. But I think you do way, way, way too much, already. You're putting us up in your home, that's enough already. We want to at least, you know, pay for the meal. It's not a big deal. I know it's not a big deal. Don't make a big deal out of it. It's all right. Don't worry about it. It's okay. So, Gloria, just do me a favor, find out how much it is for the BLT. What did you get again? Just the Cobb salad. Cobb salad. BILL: Please. Please, No, we'll take care of it. Just let us pay. It will be so much easier... Just let them pay. ...if you just let them pay. I can't let you. ...taken care of it. Dad, let them pay. Please let them pay. Just let us pay. I can't let you pay. ELLIE: It's so easy. I don't know what you're so upset about. I mean, I'm a working guy. I like to pay my own way. I don't want to owe anybody anything. I'm upset because you're supposed to be getting to know Ellie's family. And instead, you made a big scene. So what? Who cares? These people are strange. Yeah, you think they are. They are strange. Are you kidding me? They wanna take a break from thinking about money. Where I come from, that's called dying. All right, that's... It's a different life. But you still gotta try. Try... I just don't know, Sebastian, I got to tell you. I don't know how you're gonna fit in. It ain't normal. I mean, your mother and me, we didn't raise you this way, so... Yeah, you raised me to marry an Italian who shouts when she's happy, and grows hair in places I didn't even know could grow. So what? That's a real woman. Your mother was a real woman, who put real food on the table, not somebody who refuses a bread basket. All right, Dad, even I have to admit the crackers were awful. It's like eating birdseed. Yeah. I didn't know whether to eat 'em with my hands or just walk around and... (MIMICKING CHICKEN CLUCKING) Exactly, and you notice how they try to downplay how fancy it is? Oh, yeah. "Excuse me? "I'm looking at this. "Excuse me. I got eyes. I can see. Hello." They walk around, saying, "Oh, yes. "The house is 60,000 square feet, "with 13 bedrooms, "but we like it because it's cozy." And then they do the opposite with the furniture. They make it sound more important than it really is. It can't just be like a regular chair. It's got to have like a whole back story. Oh, yeah. I mean, what... "This is the chair Thomas Jefferson sat in "when he signed the treaty of Who-the-Hell-Cares?" "Well, the toilet is where Abe Lincoln took a dump. "There's a plaque right there." "Oh, do they got a place for his hat in there, too?" I mean, I don't know if I'm in a house or I'm in a museum. So, tell us, what's new in Chicago? How's the art? Well, it's, um... Yes? It's great. Yes. All my pieces from my last show sold out at the opening. I mean... Well, that's something... That's amazing! ...to crow about. Yeah, right? So, now that you're getting all these contacts, you could probably work from anywhere. Mom, stop, no. Right, sweetie? Right? Sebastian and I love living in Chicago. BOTH: Oh. But we miss having you there in D.C. We really do. We really do. We do. These cheeks aren't as fun to kiss on FaceTime. Oh, my God. I want a cheek, too. Where's my cheek? Where's my cheek? (ELLIE LAUGHING AWKWARDLY) Excuse me. Excuse me. You guys aren't supposed to be talking during a sound bath. Oh, God. Oh, of course. Sorry. Sorry, Dougie. No. No, this is... Sorry, sorry, sorry. This is wonderful. Please keep bathing us in sound. Yes. Go, with your... Yeah. Dad, listen. We're here because I wanna marry Ellie. So, it don't matter how it works with these people. It works with her. So, come on. Tomorrow, please, can you give these people a chance? Got it. Got it. No problem, no problem. Because at the end of the day, son, it's your life. Night cologne? Yep. Look at this. Pink sheets? SALVO: What? Well, we're in a dollhouse. (SEBASTIAN CHUCKLES) Mom, Dad, I would love to live closer, you know that. And? But... Sebastian has his dad, and a great job. Yeah, working for the damn Hiltons. (WHISPERING) The Hiltons. Such a good gig. Do you still have to have herpes to work there? The point is... Thank you for that. ...that he loves it, and I couldn't just ask him to leave. Sure, but that house that you guys live in, it's so cramped. We prefer "modest." You don't go on vacations. Because we're working. LUCKY: And all that cologne? They made my chopper smell like a Nordstrom's. God! I hate it when you guys gang up on me like this. It's not fair! And like it or not, Mom, Dad, and Lucky... Ow! Sebastian and I are very happy together, and we're staying in Chicago. (GASPS) I'm sorry, Dougie. Okay. I can't open chakras like this. I'm gonna go call my girlfriend. (SOBBING) Oh, no! It's fine. It's fine. LUCKY: Oh, shit! Bitcoin's down. (PEACOCK SQUAWKS) Will you look at us? Walking through a gated community as guests. Not groundskeepers. Yeah. Well, I just hope nothing gets stolen this weekend, 'cause these people love to blame the immigrants. Look at this one. Look at this one. What'd she do? Take the gym equipment home? Morning! Hello. Beautiful day, isn't it? Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta be kidding me. What the hell's her problem? "Beautiful day." Give me a break. She's happy, Dad. She probably had a father that let her sleep in past 5:45. I mean, I can't stop thinking about how much work I'm missing. I could've done four dyes and a perm by now. Two electric bills I could've paid. Two. (BELL RINGING) Good morning. Hello. (MOCKINGLY) "Good morning." Come on. What you talking about? She's in a bathrobe. I can't believe this. I mean, don't these people have jobs? It's a holiday weekend. Plus, they got their money in the stock market. Not mayonnaise jars buried in their backyard. Just relax. Come on, Dad. (EXAGGERATING) It's a beautiful day! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) SALVO: Back and forth, back and forth. You play this game? Come on. (PLAYERS CONTINUE GRUNTING) The outfits? The wives with their culos hanging out for everybody to see? And when they hit a ball, it sounds like they're having an orgasm. They're hitting a ball. Come on. The only reason I agreed to play is so you could spend some time with Bill. So just relax and do what we came to do. Yeah, I am relaxed. Look, I got sandals on. I'm relaxed. You look like the guy who killed John Wick's dog. Who's that? I don't even know who that is. (SIGHS) TIGGER: So Ellie tells me you're quite the player. Yeah, I've taken a couple lessons. Well, get ready to bring it. I love my family everywhere, except on the tennis court. Chest-bump! Oh, wow! Oh, jeez, that's uncomfortable. Let's do this. Mom, you ready? (MOUTHING) LUCKY: It's time for tennis, baby! (LUCKY GRUNTS) (HITS BALL) So, hey, Bill... Yeah? So how long you been in the hotel business? Oh, yes, well, 50 years. A long time. My whole life. Yeah. But then it's... I guess it's a pretty exciting thing to do. I love it. I love it. I got... I got hotel... I got... I got hotels in my blood. Just like you have hair in your blood. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Right? I mean... Yo, Sea Bass. Hope you got on your oven mitts. 'Cause here comes the heat. (GRUNTS) Oh. (GRUNTS) LUCKY: Oh, my God! SEBASTIAN: Sorry. What the hell was that, Sebastian? Ellie told me you had game. Sorry. BILL: Didn't come easy. I got, uh, kicked out of Harvard for playing the sax. I know, it's a long story. But my dad, he got mad. He said, "That's it. You make it on your own." He gave me one hotel. One. Wow. Yeah. That's impressive. Well... (CHUCKLES) My father gave me a mule. Next day it died. (GRUNTS) Gah! ♪ Put the macaroni in the pot and cook it♪ (TRILLING) What's that, Doug? It's an adult coloring book. LUCKY: Hey, man, you wanna take a break for some more water or some more tennis lessons? (LAUGHING) What is going on? What? You love tennis, and it's like you're not even trying out here. Come on, it's just a game. Well... (SIGHS) All right. At least take off this stupid tracksuit. No, it's cold. Leave it on. Leave it on. You must be sweating... No, I'm cold. I'm cold. ...your tits off! You're not cold. Wait a sec. Are you embarrassed to play because your dad is watching? Listen, he's not the biggest fan of sports like this. And I don't really feel like going over there and explaining to him that I'm paying a guy to teach me how to play. Well, you should know that my mother is not a "big fan" of losing either. Yeah. (GRUNTS) Listen, at least she stopped chest-bumping me. The only breasts I wanna feel in this family are yours. Not if you lose. Sebastian, did Ellie ever tell you about the guy she dated, during her semester abroad in Scotland? Is that Andy-frickin'-Murray? Never lost a match with him on my team. I wonder what he's up to. LUCKY: Hey, you know what? I'll play with my weak hand. That way you guys have, like, a shot. (LAUGHS) Is that cool, Mom? SEBASTIAN: Until then, my nightmare had been letting my father see me enjoy this life. So, much like the kick serve I learned from a Swedish pro named Johannes, this would be the point of no return. (CON TE PARTIRO BY ANDREA BOCELLI PLAYING) TIGGER: Ooh! (STRIKING TENNIS BALL) Oh, no. You see this? (DISTORTED) Crud! (DISTORTED) I am calm! Serve! This a game you can pick up fast? Not at this level. BILL: My, my. Sebastian, he's got game. You must be very proud. (OPERA MUSIC CONTINUES) (DISTORTED GROANING) Lucky! Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. (GASPS) So sorry, Luck. Oh, that's okay, Sebastian. I'm sure it was an accident. ELLIE: Oh, my God. Quick! Bill! Get a small cup of ice water for his testes. BILL: Here. LUCKY: What? I'm way ahead of you, sweetheart. LUCKY: No, no, no. no. Here, this is ice tea. It's not gonna hurt. Easy, son. Rest easy. Nice and cool. We're gonna cool my future grandbabies. Stop what you're doing! No, no, no. No, no, no. Do you want me to squeeze one, sweetie... Take these. Hold these. ...just to feel how it is? Trust me. LUCKY: Don't touch. TIGGER: Oh, okay. SALVO: When did you learn to play tennis like that, anyway? I took a few lessons for Ellie, all right? It's not that big of a deal. So how much this cost you? SEBASTIAN: To all the immigrant kids watching, you know when you get that question, you always give them the parent price. Uh, $40. Forty? You're telling me you paid the price of a long hair blowout for somebody to teach you a game? I mean, what am I gonna say? SEBASTIAN: Now, just imagine how he'd react if I told him the actual price was 80. Next thing I know, you'll be serving me the bird crackers. (MIMICKING FEEDING A BIRD) Son, serve me the bird crackers. Come on. It's a hobby, Dad. A lot of people have them, all right? Stop acting like I'm joining a cult. Well, it is a cult. Only instead of Kool-Aid, they're serving champagne. (ALL CHEERING) BILL: Mmm. Welcome, everyone, to the S.S. Collins. Uh, fun fact. I won this boat, playing backgammon with Sir Richard Branson. So for us, every voyage is a Virgin one. (CHUCKLING) Good one, sir. Thanks. Now, Bill and I have been talking, and we were going to wait until the weekend to do this, but, um, now we're just too excited. All right. Uh, Sebastian, as a lifelong hotelier, and the father of the most wonderful girl in the world... I love you. ...I have to say, it just killed me... killed... Kills us. Kills us. Yes. We are dead, thinking that you are working for our biggest competitor. So... Go on. Shall I? Yes. Right now? Please do. BILL: Okay. Daddy, what is it? On behalf of the Collins Hotel group, I would love you to join our side and become the new face of the luxurious five-star experience, that is... drum roll, (VOCALIZING DRUM ROLL) The Barrymore Hotel. Go on. Yeah. (ELLIE AND TIGGER GASP) (TIGGER CHEERING) Not kidding. SEBASTIAN: What? Are you serious? BILL: Not kidding. Very serious. SEBASTIAN: This is your signature property. The most prestigious hotel in D.C. Yeah, it better be. We just spent $240 million restoring it. Uh, Dad, I thought you were saving that job for me. We regularly drug test. Oh. Okay then. Mom, Dad, this is so generous. TIGGER: We wouldn't do this if we didn't think he was perfect for the job. Come on, let's go get some more champagne. Let's take a look. I mean... Let's take a look at... What? ...what you're... I can't believe this. ...going to be the new manager of. Now this was built in 1896. It's been completely restored, down to the dings and the doorknobs. (BOTH CHUCKLING) BILL: Take a look. No, they're all... Everything. Hey, uh, Doug, what are you doing? Just getting the blood flowing. Your face is getting a little red. Yeah, I... I feel dizzy. Yeah, me, too. Oh, that's the Jackie Onassis boardroom. She was never there, but we wish she would have been. (BOTH CHUCKLING) This painting in the lobby here looks... Yes, we... There's art. Oh, we have... Yes. This painting in the board room. Yeah, there's a painting. I recognize that sunset. Wait a minute. Did you buy Ellie's paintings? Does she know? We bought a few through this designer that we know, it's no big deal. We're supporting our baby's dream. Let's close this. (TIGGER CHUCKLING) A little champagne. Oh, good. I'll have some. I'll have some. ELLIE: Excuse me, Daddy. So, what are you thinking? Yeah, well, Bill, that's a very generous offer, but Sebastian obviously has to think about that. Right? Yeah. Absolutely, Dad. Yeah. Of course. This would be a big move for everyone, so please, take your time. Talk it over. Right. And then tell us what day to send the moving trucks. (TIGGER LAUGHING) Dad. (ALL LAUGHING) Oh, this is so cool! So cool! Hey, as a possible member of our, um, family company, how about we celebrate with a little jet-booting, huh? Oh, that sounds great, man. Count me in. What's jet-booting? Whoo! Whoa! This is amazing, Lucky! All right! Look at you. Baby, you're doing so good! I feel like I'm flying! Whoa! Use your core! I'm actually smiling. (ELLIE CHEERING) This smile is real. (ELLIE CHEERING) Salvo, would you like to borrow some swim trunks? We have a hot tub upstairs. I'm fine. I'm trying to watch him. Oh. Make sure he's okay. Hey... (SIGHS) I just wanted to thank you for looking after Ellie in Chicago. We feel so lucky she's met your son. Well, he's a good kid. Thanks. (FAINTLY) I'm king of the world! (CHUCKLES) Always out making an ass of himself. (LAUGHING) I know you guys are close, so if they do end up in D.C., I promise we will take good care of him. Honestly, I wouldn't get your hopes up. I can't imagine Sebastian ever leaving Chicago or me. 'Cause I'm the only family he's got. I used to say the same thing about Ellie. Hey, Dad! Check it out! I can dive! Look at that. He's very athletic. He's quite good. SEBASTIAN: Dad! Yeah, he gets it from my side. Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Look at this! Oh, my gosh! Oh, shit! (LAUGHING) Sebastian, your suit! It's Versace. Do you like it? No, you moron! It's not up! Look down! SEBASTIAN: Oh, God! Hey, Bubba Gump! Nice shrimp! SEBASTIAN: I can't get it. Whoa! Oh! LUCKY: Whoa! You good, man? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) What's the matter with you? Pull up your pants! SEBASTIAN: I can't reach it. Hey, what the hell do I do? (GRUNTS) Son, your sail is at half-mast. Oh, no, no, uh, it looks like it's full mast. SEBASTIAN: Oh, no! (YELLING) (THUDS) (GLASS SQUEAKING) SALVO: Sebastian! BILL: No, no. Okay, don't... TIGGER: No! Stay down! No, no. No. Stay down. Stay down. No! Okay. Okay. God! All right, that is not appropriate. TIGGER: I'm going to be sick. BILL: No, it's... Honey, my mom can't unsee that. LUCKY: Hey, Sea Bass! Say hi to TikTok. Dad, what the hell you doing? Packing. I'm going back to Chicago tomorrow morning. What, are you crazy? We're not leaving. You didn't even give me the ring yet. Trust me. What I saw today, you don't come back from. Oh, stop being so dramatic. It was from far away. Nobody saw much. Yeah, that's for sure. Look, I know I haven't seen you naked since the delivery room, but is it possible your pisellino hasn't even grown since then? Would you put the suitcase away? No, I'm gonna bring you home, set you up with some Italian girls, help you start over fresh. And I even got a nice new hairstyle for you. Dad, I'm in love with Ellie. That wouldn't change if I accidentally showed my balls to the entire world. Oh, is that what you got planned for tomorrow? Son, you gotta stop pretending that you fit in with these people, because you don't. I'm not pretending. Are you serious? I mean, every time you're with this family, you make a fool of yourself. Because you raised me to be afraid of trying anything new. I mean, God. Dad, listen, I honestly... I was nervous to bring you here. 'Cause I knew you would just sit here, and judge with your black shirt, your zipper purse, your resting bitch face. Hey, I don't have resting bitch face. We look like Italian gargoyles. You look like you're gonna murder the entire neighborhood. You know what your problem is? You're so negative, you can't let yourself enjoy anything, so you think I can't either. Dad, Ellie is my future. And I'm gonna keep an open mind about everything. Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, everything? Even the job offer? Maybe. It's a pretty good one. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. (DRAWER CLOSES) Unbelievable. (SIGHS) First, your mother is taken away from me. Now you wanna leave. I'm not leaving you, Dad. Ellie's the best thing that ever happened to me. And when I get married, not if, her family is going to be a big part of the package. Now, I want you to be a part of my life. But if that's gonna happen, you gotta give me some effort. I wanna see the Salvo at the salon that everybody loves. And if I don't, I got no choice but to leave you behind. I don't know. How can you say that? How can you say that? How could you say that to your father? You got no respect for your family. I got enough respect to know we could go to bed angry but not stinky. Come on. Now, come on, let's do our night spritz. I miss you, and I wish you were here for so many reasons. So many reasons, just... For one, just tell me, am I being an asshole? Are we really doing the right thing for our son? Just give me some kind of sign, something. Please? Just let me know what you think. I... I... Give me some sign, honey. (LEAVES RUSTLING) (PEACOCK SQUAWKING) (FLUTE PLAYING) I love you. (FLUTE PLAYING FOLK TUNE) Hi, Doug. Hello. What are you doing? I was just serenading the peacocks. (CHUCKLES) Oh. Would you be open enough to doing a healing session with me? A healing session? It'll be very beneficial for you. Well, that's a nice offer, but I don't know if I even know what you're talking about. Well, just start by shutting your eyes, and then, really, just focus on your breathing. In your nose. Out your nose. And if you can, really try to connect to that little Salvo, that was afraid when you were young. I don't even know where he is anymore. That's so long ago. You know, I'm in another... I'm in another life. Let me help you find him, okay? Just stay with your breath. (PLAYING FOLK TUNE) Heal, little Salvo. Okay, I feel better. (STOPS PLAYING) You do? Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. I'm gonna go to sleep. Okay. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Good night, Doug. I'm glad I could help. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Big help. (PEACOCK SQUAWKING IN DISTANCE) SEBASTIAN: Yesterday was a day of regrettable firsts. I yelled at my father and I showed my balls to my future in-laws. But who knows? Maybe everybody forgot? Well, there's the big swimmer. Hey, did you see the full moon last night? Okay. Just... I'm talking about your butt. BILL: All right. Ignore him. His butt cheeks are the full moon. Yes, I understand. Um, how you doing, kiddo? I'm all right. BILL: Good. Have you seen my dad? BILL: Yes. He is out taking a walk with Ellie, Doug and Tigger. A walk? BILL: Yes, he was... he was... Well, here. (DOOR OPENS) Speak of the devil. SALVO: So I says to him... I says, "Why would I buy you a skateboard "when I can build you one?" Holy Mother of God. Sleepy head, I was just telling 'em about the time I gave you a skateboard for Christmas. You remember that? Ah, I remember that. Yeah. What time did you get up anyway? I got up early. I didn't want to wake you, so I snuck out, did my laundry, watched TV, fixed one of their bannisters, reorganized the spice rack. Then when the sun came up, I started making breakfast. Then I went for a walk to get to know the family. Good people, these Collins. Good people. Even the commie. Oh, I'm a socialist. Well, whatever you say, Che Guevara. (CHUCKLES) Oh, that's funny. (TIGGER CHUCKLING) (SOFTLY) Get over here. What the hell's going on? What do you mean, what's going on? I'm doing what you asked me to do. Making an effort, like you asked. Okay. No, I appreciate it. But Jesus, the shorts. Yeah. So what? I've never seen your legs before. (HESITATES) Yeah, you haven't. That's right. They're not too bad. They look like pretzel sticks in socks. Don't blame me. This is what these people gave me, you know? What can I tell you? I want to join the fun. And I feel great, and I can't wait to see what the universe suggests after I opened my eyes. We did a healing session together. Yeah. Little Salvo's not afraid anymore. Little Salvo? Yeah. TIGGER: I hope everyone's ready for Family Fun Day. BILL: I am. I am. SEBASTIAN: Oh, what's Family Fun Day? What? (CHUCKLES) What, are you dense? Everything you need to know is in the name. Duh! Duh! Okay. BOTH: Salud! (WHISPERS) What the hell is this? ELLIE: It's a big 4th of July tradition. There's relay races, and croquet, and face painting, and a hot dog eating contest. It's just a lot of fun. (CROWD CHEERING) SEBASTIAN: I know I'd asked the man to start making an effort, but this was crazy. I felt like I created a monster. Except instead of looking scary, he was smiling, playing games, dressing like the American flag. All right! The Maniscalcos. What's your angle here? No angle. I'm happy. I'm with my family. Say, "Fireworks." Fireworks. Chee... Say firework. (ALL CHEERING, CLAPPING) It's like bocce with sticks. (ALL LAUGHING) All right. You wanna take a look? Nice. Right? And the winner of this year's 4th of July hot dog eating contest is Salvo Manisculo! (ALL CHEERING) SEBASTIAN: My father was having a great time, and suddenly, I was the one who was uncomfortable. I wanted him to make an effort, not change who he was completely. SEBASTIAN: There he is. (DOOR CLOSES) The MVP. What are you doing? Checking out your hardware? I just figured out how these people stay so rich. They do everything on the cheap. (TAPPING) Hear that? Plastic. Huh. Just enjoy it, will you, please? I mean, you kicked some ass out there today, and I think these people are starting to like you. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. They're just being polite. I'm serious. Bill even has a signature scent now. Oh, yeah? What brand? He won't divulge. He won't divulge? Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Salvo. SALVO: I wanna smell that. Oh, my God. I've been looking all over for you. Um, so, my mom just got invited to be on MSNBC in two hours. That's great. Yes. Well, it would be, but Tyler, well, he's in Sedona, and I have no one to do my hair. So we were thinking maybe you could help her out. I mean, that's like asking Van Gogh to draw a smiley face. ELLIE: Yes! TIGGER: Great! (RELAXING MUSIC PLAYING) TIGGER: Mmm. I'd be lying to you if I told you I didn't have my eyes on your lustrous mane all weekend. It's nice to finally get my hands up in here. Hmm. I am very grateful. Ah. Are those cigars? Yeah. Can I have one? Oh, boy. This day just keeps getting better and better. Of course, you can have one. Be my guest. Oh! Only the best. Can I have one? Oh, please join me. Okay. (SNIFFS) Fine. (LIGHTER CLICKS) Mmm. You know, I never met a woman who smokes cigars before. Yeah? I got hooked in the Navy. Wait a minute. You're military? Mmm-hmm. I thought you went to one of those Ivy places. I enlisted after graduation. I just felt a duty to my country. But mostly, I did it to piss off my parents. You? Army. Combat? Cook. Ah! Well, happy 4th to you. You, too. You, too. Salud. It's nice to have another actual vet out here to celebrate. Oh! (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) ELLIE: (WHISPERS) Hey. (WHISPERING) How's it going? I can't hear anything. So they're either getting along, or they're quietly stabbing each other. Listen, I have great news. What's up? Okay. So, that decorator that bought all my work, they've already placed all the pieces. They can't say where for privacy reasons, but it probably means that they're gonna want a lot more. That's great! Isn't it? (GASPS) Wait. Why is your voice going up? Why does your face look like that? What's going on? Listen, babe, I... (TIGGER SCREAMING) SALVO: Voila. (GASPS) (SEBASTIAN EXCLAIMS IN SURPRISE) Oh, what... What is this? What... This isn't at all what I asked you to do. Well, yeah. You see, I don't really do requests. The way I work is, I look at your face, I get a sense of your aura, who you are, then I let that dictate the style that your personality demands. I am about to go on television, and I just... I just wanted to look like myself. (GASPS) Oh! (WHIMPERING) Bill, do I look horrible? No, no, no. TIGGER: No? It is not horrible. It's... Ellie? Um, I just feel like... I don't know what it is. Dad, couldn't you just ditch the aura crap, and give her what she wanted? Whoa! That's like asking Caravaggio to go back in, and retouch up the beheading of Holofernes. The what a... Who? I don't do that. Can we, as a family, please force Doug to stop wearing that organic de... Holy shit, Mom! Oh. Why do you have the exact same haircut as Salvo? That's it. Oh, my God. I don't think so. LUCKY: You guys look like those weird boy-girl twins that, like, just dress the same. Salvo, how could you do this to me? Wait, wait, wait. First of all, I didn't realize I was doing anything. I mean, to me, you look powerful, gorgeous. You look, dare I even say it, sexy. Well, I am supposed to go on TV in 10 minutes, and you have made me look like a bitter old Italian man! Everybody, please, get out. Go, go, go, go, go. Sweetheart. Mommy, maybe you... Get out! With all due respect, Chris, the existing policy has been working for two decades. Why change now? Ah, she's kicking ass. She's pretty much talking about you. Oh, stop being so dramatic. You don't just make major decisions based on instincts. You've gotta listen to the people you're servicing, or someone's gonna end up dead. CHRIS: All right. Yeah. Well, okay. Maybe you got a point. CHRIS: Uh, Senator MacArthur, I'm actually... I'm very sorry... Sorry to cut you short. "Cut me short"? Did you say "cut me short"? Is that some kind of sick joke, Chris, huh? Uh, as you can see, uh, very strong feelings, uh, coming out of this story. We're gonna continue to follow its developments for you. Listen, when this is all over, you better apologize. Apologize? For what? For what? She wanted a touch up. You made her look like David Bowie. What? Are you kidding me? I gave her a 'do that was very age appropriate and dignified. She should be thanking me. I wouldn't hold my breath, Salvo. Oh, is she really pissed off? When I left, she was googling homemade poisons. I don't know if it was for Salvo or for herself. Oh. I don't get it. Most women would be honored to have their hair done by East Chicago's three-time Hair Stylist of the Year. That was in the 80's. The 80's. So what? That's the golden age of hair. (ELLIE AND SEBASTIAN GROAN) Hi, Mom. Would you go talk to her? Say something? What am I going to say? Just say something, all right? Hey, uh, Tig. Tig? Uh... Tigger. Tigger, I just want to say you looked so good up there on the box. Really, really. Very, very dignified. "On the box?" Get on your feet, and go over there. All right? All right. (CLEARS THROAT) Uh, Tig, uh... I just wanna... tell you I'm sorry for giving you a very high-quality hairdo without your permission. I heard the word "sorry." But then you followed it up with a compliment to yourself. Well, if I'm being honest, I never gave that style to anybody else before. So I really think your aura commands the respect that I typically only reserve for myself. So I am sorry that I, you know, didn't do exactly what you asked for. Thanks. You know? Hey, you know what? Let... Let me make an offer. I would love to make a full Italian dinner for everybody. That sounds so nice. How about that? And also as a thank you, and with great appreciation, for letting us stay in this beautiful home. That won't be necessary. We don't keep a lot of food here and the markets are closed for the holiday. Don't worry. A Maniscalco always finds a way to feed his family, right? Yep. You got it. I think it's a wonderful idea. I mean, if you look like an Italian man, why not eat like one, huh? (CHUCKLING) No, I mean, if you... I meant Italian... TIGGER: Shut up, Bill. I'll be sleeping on the couch tonight. (GUARDA COME DONDOLO BY EDOARDO VIANELLO PLAYING) SEBASTIAN: Everybody likes to talk about how bad social media is. But in this case, it really worked out for my dad. Senator Tigger MacArthur is going viral today, and for the first time, for all the right reasons. This new haircut is giving me like... G.I. Jane two months out of boot camp. It's giving me gender fluidity. It's giving me fresh, hot, gorgeous. Whoever did that haircut, America thanks you. Ah! SEBASTIAN: Now that Tigger's approval rating was through the roof, she was happy to let my dad back under hers. (MOUTH FULL) So good. So, this is delicious. I can't believe that you put this all together from what we have in the kitchen. My guess is he raided the kitchen over at The Shack. So, you might wanna call Gloria over there, see if you got some inventory. Mmm, mmm. (MOUTH FULL) What do you call this again, Salvo? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) It is delicious. I'm going for seconds. Don't tell my trainer. It's really good. I just wish you hadn't used my bowls. (CHUCKLES) Well, you know, I used your bowls, Doug, because I wanted to add a special spiritual reverberation to the meal. So, that's why, you know? Okay. Yeah. So, thank you for that contribution. Okay. Salvo, it's delicious. (MOUTH FULL) Delicious. Listen, given everything you're doing for my son, this is the least I can do. Oh. And I just wanna say something that my father used to say. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) The translation is, "The family isn't just one important thing, "it's everything." And I like to toast to that. BILL: Lovely. Salud! ALL: Salud! ELLIE: To everything. Salud. Cheers, everybody. BILL: Well said. (WOMEN EXCLAIMING) Watch it, watch it. Oh, collision! BILL: Cut him off. Time for some more vino, huh? ELLIE: Oh, yes. When in Rome. Because, you know, you guys are Italian. (ALL LAUGHING) You got a problem with Italians, Bill? Yeah, Bill. (STUTTERING NERVOUSLY) (ALL LAUGHING) Who got you? Come on, Bill! I thought he was serious. (CHUCKLES) (BOTTLE CLANKS ON COUNTER) (SOFTLY) What's this? You know, just... (UNZIPS ZIPPER) ...the sexiest way I can think of to say thank you. Here? Are you kidding me? (SHUSHING) They're in the next room. (SHUSHING) You know I'm a screamer. I know. Just come over here. Oh! Oh, yeah. (SEBASTIAN MOANS) (ELLIE MOANS) (SEBASTIAN SPEAKING ITALIAN) Hmm? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) ELLIE: What, baby? What? Oh, we got to go inside. I'm getting eaten alive. What? What are you talking about? I saw a raccoon. Is that a safe word? There's raccoons everywhere. Raccoon? Yeah. Where? What raccoon? SEBASTIAN: There's some wildlife. Honey, there's no raccoons. BILL: (DISTORTED) Mmm. SEBASTIAN: Seeing my future in-laws eat their family pet is is as close to an acid trip as I ever wanna be. (DISTORTED) Here comes the airplane. (LUCKY MIMICS ENGINE WHIRRING) Ah, no! (DISTORTED) This Italian food's going to my head. (MIMICS CHICKEN CLUCKING) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) SEBASTIAN: This was proof the man was diabolical. I murdered Sergeant Feathers. (SCREAMS) I can't believe you fed 'em a peacock. How could you do this? Easy. My recipe called for chicken. All the stores were closed. So what does a great chef do? He improvises. By murdering their beloved mascot? They still got three left. Are you kidding me? Where we come from, it's called, "You gotta do what you gotta do to feed the family." It's called the peasant mentality. Look around, Dad. These people aren't peasants. And you thought I was crazy for worrying that you were gonna make us look like some bad Italian stereotype? Come on. You know I'm not doing that. Are you blind? Look at... We are in the woods in the middle of the night trying to get rid of a freakin' body. That's right. To help me get rid of the evidence. Why does it seem like you've done this before? (MUMBLING) Stupid bird! It's dead! What are you doing? Look at its feathers. Night cologne? (CLEARS THROAT) Listen, son, I was just trying to help you win this family over by making a good meal, that's all. Well, if this is your idea of help, I think I'm good, Dad. Jesus. Why do I feel like you're trying to wreck this for me? Wreck it? I'm just making an effort like you asked me to do. Well, it turns out the only thing worse than you not trying is you trying. Well, maybe to you, but to me, these people, they seem to like me. Like you? If I told these people the truth about what happened, they'd never have us back here. (SIGHS) You know, why did I let Ellie convince me to bring you here? What do you mean, "bring me here"? You're the one who invited me, didn't you? Yeah, I invited you to get grandma's ring. I didn't know you were gonna spend the whole time sabotaging me. What are you talking about, "sabotaging"? How could you say that? Everything I'm doing for you, that I've ever done for you is for your own good, to give you a better life. You love to say that, but now that I'm gonna get it, it's like you're trying to stop it. Trying to stop what? I'm trying to make sure that you don't make an ass out of yourself by trying to be somebody you're not. You're your own person. You're your own man. Be your own man. Otherwise, it's embarrassing. (SCOFFING) Oh, man. You know what? This is your problem. You're so focused on other people being embarrassed, you can't see who the most embarrassing person is. It's you. (SIGHS) That's really what you think? Let's just go to sleep, all right? (BEDSHEETS RUSTLING) SEBASTIAN: The next morning, it was the 4th of July, which made sense, 'cause I was finally getting my independence. It was an amazing feeling. But much like my signature scent, it was a little bittersweet. But this was the beginning of my new life. And now that I had the ring, it was time to make my move. SEBASTIAN: I've given this a lot of thought over the last few days, and on top of accepting your very generous offer to run the Barrymore Hotel, I would also like to ask your permission to propose to Ellie. Oh. Ah, that doesn't... I... (SIGHS) We're kidding! (TIGGER CHUCKLES) (BILL LAUGHING) We got him. Ho! You should've seen the look on your face. Priceless. Our answer is an emphatic... BOTH: Yes! Oh, God. Gee, Sebastian, we just love you. And we just... We cannot wait for you and Ellie to join the party in D.C. TIGGER: Yes. And this is perfect. We're doing our family Christmas card photo today. You can propose there, and then be in it! Oh, thank God. I was so nervous how you guys would react to this, you know? Especially, what's happened this weekend with my father. No. That dinner was wonderful. (BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) Yeah. Fantastic. Memorable. TIGGER: Chicken al cavone. (BILL SPEAKING ITALIAN) Fantastic. Never had it. BILL: Terrific. TIGGER: Yes. Don't know what's in it. (SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) What the hell kind of elf are you supposed to be? I'm representing all the holiday traditions. Nice. (CHUCKLES) You're as plump as a little partridge. Yes. (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, oh. Hey, you fit right in. Uh, I don't know. Can I propose first and then put on the tree costume? (BOTH LAUGHING) What's the difference? Oh, E... Ellie. Ellie, where's your costume? BILL: We... We can't do this without our reindeer. I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna be taking the photo this year, because I no longer wanna be a part of this family. Also, Sebastian isn't taking the job, we are not moving to D.C. and we're not gonna spend any more time with these manipulators. So, let's go. What happened? What's happened? Dad, what do all of your hotels have in common? Five-star experience at a three-star price. (BILL CHUCKLING) No. The answer is their lobby art. Oh. Shall we start with the Barrymore Hotel? Uh-oh. Shall we? Come on. No, I don't need to see... Oh, look. Do you notice anything familiar about the walls? Well, no. That's my painting, isn't it? Well, what's that? My painting. My painting. Oh, yeah, my painting. BILL: All right. It was your dad's idea! Wait. Just wait. It was your dad's idea. No. One second here. (MOUTHING) It was him. I just wanna know how you found out. Sebastian, did you tell her? What? You knew about this? Well, no, I kind of saw... I can't believe that you all did this to me. Ellie, we can explain. We can explain. No, Mom! This whole time I thought I was selling my art to this cool new designer, when really my parents just hired them to buy my work. No, no, no, darling. No, that's not... No. Yes. Yes, that is technically true. I thought I was killing it in the art world! We just wanted you to get a jump-start in a really, really rough business. It's so terrible out there. You know how rough it is. It's what you always do. You're always... You're just stealing our lessons. You bribe our way onto sports teams, you rewrite our college essays, you hire famous rappers to emcee our birthday parties. That was also not my idea. Okay. So what? Now you don't like Warren G? Look, you guys are great parents. Don't let her guilt you into changing your ways. All I have ever wanted was to feel like I was accomplishing things on my own. And I can't believe that you just didn't say something to me. Sweetheart, we, um... Oh, my gosh. I told you. Well, yeah. (DOUG SNORING) SEBASTIAN: I'd been so focused on trying to please Ellie's family, that I lost sight of what I came here to do. I had to find Ellie and make this right. And I knew exactly where she'd be. Permission to approach? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Place could use a remodel, huh? I'm sorry. I should've said something. Yeah, you should have. Is there anything I could do to make it up to you? Just being in this family is like bowling with bumpers. It's like, no matter what I try to do, they're always setting up rails to make sure that I win. And sometimes, I just want to free bowl, because then, that way if I bowl a strike, then that's my strike. But if I gutter it, then that's on me too. I understand. You want to work hard for your own success. Yes. Do you remember when you told me the story about how Salvo taught you how to swim? He dropped me in the middle of Lake Michigan in November. Listen, I know he's a pain in the ass, but he also raised you to be tough and resourceful. And those are two things I really love about you. And I kind of wish that my parents had raised me more like that. SEBASTIAN: And that was the moment everything finally started to make sense. Here I was, planning to propose to the girl of my dreams, and I was gonna do it without the man who raised me? I realized I had everything I wanted, but not what I needed. I gotta go do something first. What? What? Trust me. Meet me at dinner. LUCKY: How's he doing back there? Keep going, bro, I'm fine. LUCKY: Okay. SEBASTIAN: There it is. That's it. LUCKY: I got you, mi hermano. You go get him. MAN 1: Hey, stop! You can't be out here! MAN 2: Sir, you have to get off the tarmac! Sir! Stop the plane. (ENGINE STOPS) Son... what are you doing? You look like you swam here. I came here to tell you that you're stubborn, you're cheap, you're obnoxious, you're severely judgmental... Wait, wait. This is what I'm getting off the plane for? Dad, but the truth is all those quirks are part of what makes you the greatest dad that I could ever hope for. Okay. Now I'm listening. Now, it ain't always easy being your son, but the way you raised me made me the man I am today. The same man, for whatever the reason, Ellie seems to love. Could never figure that one out, either, but you know... You got your grandmother's ring. What else you need from me? I need you to be part of our lives, Dad. But you said I was embarrassing. You are. You haven't changed one bit since I was a kid. You know who did? I changed. And I think somewhere along the way, I forgot. (CHUCKLING) You're my hero, man. Stop. No. You are. All the stuff you sacrifice. Everything that's good in my life, I owe it to you. No. It's... it's... (VOICE BREAKS) It's that good things happen to good kids. You're a good boy. It's just that I've been acting crazier lately, (VOICE BREAKS) because... I... I... I was so poor, for me to give you a better life, (CRYING) and now that you're going to have it, and I'm afraid that once you marry Ellie, I'm gonna lose the only family I got. Oh, Dad, you're not gonna lose me. Don't worry. Stop... don't cry, Dad. You're going to make me cry. Well, I can't help it. (CRYING) I love you, man. I love you, Dad. I love you too, kid. Love you. (TEARFULLY) Are you crying? What? Are you crying? Hell, no. I never cry! (MA IL CIELO E SEMPRE PIU BLU BY RINO GAETANO PLAYING) (PLAYING FLUTE) Wow! I don't know why I was so scared. This is really beautiful. SALVO: Yeah. (THUDDING) Oh, my God! We're going down! Oh, my God! I'm just kidding. I'm going to kill you, Luck! (SEBASTIAN BREATHING HEAVILY) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this year's 4th of July clambake. (BAND PLAYING SLOW JAZZ) TIGGER: Well, so far, a very pleasant evening. BILL: Mmm-hmm. Thank you, my darling. Such a treat. Hats off to that new chef, huh? Outstanding. Of course, you can't go wrong with lobster. (CHUCKLES) Oh, sweetie, did you lose your appetite? Do you wanna buy me one? (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) All right, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you brought your dancing shoes tonight... (MICROPHONE FEEDBACK) Because... Thank you, Mr. Woodrow. Because we've got a real treat for you guys tonight. Please welcome, all the way from Chicago, Illinois, Sebastian Maniscalco. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) Ellie Collins, you asked for this. I wonder what this is about. I don't know. Eleanor Mallory Collins. What are you doing? Exactly what I came here to do. Now, my father said something really profound this weekend. It's an old Italian saying, "Family isn't one important thing, "it's everything." Now, yeah, they could be embarrassing. Smothering. Sometimes maybe express their love in ways that are pretty... Messed up. Exactly. ELLIE: Yeah. But at the end of the day they're... they're just trying to do what's best for us. Because they love us. Now here, in this moment, in front of our families... Ellie... will you marry me? Yes. SEBASTIAN: Oh. (PEOPLE CHEERING) SEBASTIAN: And there you have it, folks. An atypical American love story about a man reconnecting with his hero, and two different brands of immigrant families coming together. Sebastian, are you sure you won't reconsider our offer? No, it's a generous offer. Yeah. But Ellie and I decided to stay in Chicago for at least a few more years. BILL: Oh! Yeah. I'm not saying a word. Heartbreaking. Dad, I was thinking since Sea Bass isn't... Yeah. gonna take the job, I thought I could... step up. No more drugs? Prescription? Mostly mine? (CHUCKLES) A dream come true. All right. Thank you. That's my boy, Lucky. LUCKY: I'm running a hotel. Hi. Hi, everybody. Um, I'd like you to meet my girlfriend, Michelle. Hello. Hi, I'm Ellie. MICHELLE: Hi. She's real. That's my sister. It's very nice to meet all of you. Did you fly all the way from... from... Africa. ...Africa (STUTTERING) ...to be with Doug? Oh, well, I love Doug. (GIGGLES) But I'm actually here on a Fulbright scholarship. She's very smart. Very nice. Well, we're just so happy to meet you. Lovely. Yes. You could sit... Mom. Dad. Yes. Yes. Where are we gonna go? Right this way. Yeah, we gotta get our picture taken. (GASPS) Don't say that I never did nothing for you. (WE NO SPEAK AMERICANO BY DCUP AND YOLANDA BE COOL PLAYING) BILL: Ah. TIGGER: Oh. How would you two feel about having the wedding in our chapel in D.C.? D.C.? No. Let's have it in Sicily. BILL: Oh, Sicily. In my grandfather's garden. That's where you should... I was thinking like Napa, because I found this place that has a big wine glass. And you can do the whole ceremony in the wine glass. Duke! Duke! No! BILL: What do you have in your mouth? BOTH: Duke murdered a peacock.
